Based on the assessment requirements outlined in the document and the suggested sequential decision model, hereâ€™s a comprehensive **workflow and breakdown for a group of 3 students** to complete this project within 3 weeks, assuming average Python knowledge:

---

### **Week 1: Research, Setup, and Initial Modeling**
#### **Goal**: Understand the problem, set up the environment, and implement foundational components.
1. **Day 1-2: Problem Understanding and Task Division**
   - **Task**: Read through the project requirements and clarify expectations with the unit leader if needed.
   - **Divide Roles**:
     - **Member 1**: State variables and environment setup.
     - **Member 2**: Decision variables and objective function design.
     - **Member 3**: Exogenous information and transition model.

2. **Day 3-4: Research and Define Framework**
   - **Research**: Study relevant methodologies (POMDPs, multi-agent systems, and weather-based decision-making).
   - **Deliverables**:
     - State variables: E.g., drone positions, battery levels, weather conditions.
     - Decision variables: Movement actions, altitude adjustments, sensor switching.
     - Transition model outline: Probability-based changes in weather, visibility, and drone states.

3. **Day 5-7: Environment and Basic Code Implementation**
   - **Implementation**:
     - Set up the environment using Python (`gym`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`).
     - Define the state and action spaces.
     - Implement the reward function based on preliminary rules.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A functioning simulation of drones moving and interacting with a simplified environment.
     - Documented pseudocode for key components.

### **Week 2: Core System Development**
#### **Goal**: Develop a detailed sequential decision-making framework and incorporate multi-agent coordination.
1. **Day 8-9: Transition Model and Exogenous Information**
   - **Task**: Implement the stochastic transition model to handle:
     - Changes in weather and visibility.
     - Oil spill spread dynamics.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Code implementing state transitions.
     - Documentation explaining how transitions are modeled.

2. **Day 10-11: Decision Variables and Objective Function**
   - **Task**: Implement decision-making logic:
     - Use rule-based policies to select actions.
     - Optimize for spill detection and energy efficiency.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Working decision-making function.
     - Preliminary results from testing.

3. **Day 12-14: Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - **Task**:
     - Implement data sharing between drones (e.g., visibility maps, spill likelihood).
     - Enable collaborative coverage of search areas.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Code for multi-agent coordination.
     - Initial plots showing drone paths and spill detection efficiency.

### **Week 3: Testing, Analysis, and Report Writing**
#### **Goal**: Validate the system, analyze results, and compile the report.
1. **Day 15-16: Validation and Testing**
   - **Task**:
     - Test the system under various scenarios (e.g., low visibility, high wind, large spill areas).
     - Record performance metrics: detection accuracy, energy usage, and coverage time.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Logs of test cases and their results.
     - Visualizations of drone paths, coverage, and efficiency.

2. **Day 17-18: Results Analysis**
   - **Task**:
     - Analyze test data.
     - Summarize key findings (e.g., strengths, weaknesses, and improvements).
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Charts, graphs, and tables demonstrating performance.
     - A clear summary of findings.

3. **Day 19-21: Report Writing and Submission Preparation**
   - **Structure the Report**:
     - Abstract: Overview and purpose of the project.
     - Introduction: Background and problem statement.
     - Methodology: Framework, state variables, decision variables, and transition model.
     - Results and Discussion: Findings with analysis.
     - Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize outcomes and suggest improvements.
   - **Task**:
     - Write individual sections based on contributions.
     - Review for consistency and completeness.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Final PDF report (3000-4000 words).
     - Submission on Moodle by all members.

### **Division of Work**
1. **Member 1**: 
   - State variable implementation.
   - Results analysis and visualization.
2. **Member 2**:
   - Decision variables and reward function implementation.
   - Report sections: Methodology and Results.
3. **Member 3**:

### **Additional Tips**
- **Code Reviews**: Schedule 10-minute daily reviews to ensure progress and address issues.
- **Document Everything**: Maintain a shared document for pseudocode, notes, and references.
- **Backup Work**: Use a shared Git repository (e.g., GitHub) to track changes and avoid data loss.
